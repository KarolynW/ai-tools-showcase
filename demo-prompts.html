  <h1>🧠 AI Workflow Demonstration: Assignment Planning with AI Tools</h1>

  <div class="tool">
    <h2>Step 1: Access an AI Chat Interface</h2>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat" target="_blank">https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat</a> and sign in using your institutional Microsoft 365 account.</p>
    <p>This will open an AI assistant interface where you can upload files and enter natural language prompts.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h2>Step 2: Download the Assignment Brief from Canvas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the assignment in Canvas (e.g. <em>Element 010: Portfolio</em>).</li>
      <li>Right-click anywhere on the page (avoiding links or images).</li>
      <li>Select <code>Save as...</code> and choose to save it as a complete HTML file.</li>
      <li>Name it something like <code>Element_010_Portfolio.html</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h2>Step 3: Upload the HTML File and Ask for a Breakdown</h2>
    <p>Upload your saved HTML file into the AI tool.</p>
    <p>Prompt:</p>
    <code>Element_010_Portfolio.html – please analyse my assignment brief presented in HTML.</code>
    <p>The tool will extract and summarise the brief, including structure, learning outcomes, and rubric details.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h2>Step 4: Request a 12-Week Project Plan</h2>
    <p>Prompt:</p>
    <code>I need help planning my assignment – it is week one. I need a weekly breakdown of tasks with actionable micro tasks to help me manage my time. I have approximately one day per week to work on this.</code>
    <p>You’ll receive a structured timeline organised by week with realistic, achievable tasks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h2>Step 5: Generate a Checklist</h2>
    <p>Prompt:</p>
    <code>I would like a checklist to mark off the work per week – assume the submission date is 05/12/2025.</code>
    <p>The AI tool generates a downloadable checklist (e.g. Word or PDF) with tick boxes for tracking progress.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h2>Step 6: Create Weekly Calendar Events</h2>
    <p>Prompt:</p>
    <code>Please create calendar reminders in .ics format – they should mark me as busy each week on Friday between 9 and 5 and list my tasks for the day.</code>
    <p>You can import the .ics file into Outlook, Google Calendar, or Apple Calendar.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h2>Step 7: Optional – Request a Mental Focus Image</h2>
    <p>Prompt:</p>
    <code>Please make an image of a calming and zen environment to focus my pre-assessment nerves.</code>
    <p>The AI tool generates a peaceful image to reduce stress and improve focus.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h2>Step 8: Use Gemini with RAG to Expand Case Study Ideas</h2>

  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h2>🎁 Bonus: Real-World AI Use, Dictation, and Extra Tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dictation as a Thinking Tool:</strong> One of the most frequent and practical uses of AI is through dictation. By speaking freely into a chat interface (especially on mobile), ideas can be rapidly captured and structured by the AI. This is particularly effective for planning, journaling, or brainstorming when your hands are busy or your thoughts are scattered.</li>
      <li><strong>Weekly Battle Plans:</strong> Mondays often begin with a verbal download of all tasks, calendar events, and lingering thoughts. This is turned into a structured action plan. Detailed prompts with step-by-step breakdowns yield the best results — and dictation makes giving detail easy and natural.</li>
      <li><strong>Multimodal Inputs:</strong> AI isn’t just about typing. Most chat platforms (including ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity) allow image uploads, file analysis (PDFs, CSVs, Docs), screenshots, audio transcription, and even Python scripting for data analysis or report generation.</li>
      <li><strong>Scribe AI:</strong> A powerful tool for automatically generating illustrated PDF tutorials by simply recording a screen walkthrough — ideal for onboarding, instructions, and documentation.</li>
      <li><strong>AI Principle:</strong> Always use AI with an expert human in the loop. Automate the mundane, humanise the exceptional.</li>
